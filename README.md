# Equalizer
A simple Matlab project about audio file

As part of my third year of studies at ECE Paris Ecole d'ing√©nieurs, 
we were asked to create a short program in GUI Matlab that allows to modify a audiofile,
as apply filters and temporals effects, and displaying the results on charts.

I think it can be usefull for students who are also asked to do the same kind of project.
